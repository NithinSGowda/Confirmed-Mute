# Mute-Perfect

Ensure that you are 100% on mute during your meetings or online classes

This simple and lightweight extension removes your camera and mic so that you can never go unmute accidentally. 
This extension is entirely focused on protecting user privacy during calls/meetings.

You can click on the extension to enable your mic or camera anytime you need. This will bring back your mic and camera options immediately.

This is a beta version under development and currently only supports Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. 
Will add additional support to cover all meeting platforms in future releases.
